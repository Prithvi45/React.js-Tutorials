Components 
1. Function based:
 - pass arguments (props) , and access by props.
 - cannot use state here

2. Class based
 - access args by this
 - use state and setState

* we can pass both  property(variables, values) and method (function) as an argument to a component
* .bind(this, args) :- used to pass arguments  



For styling css 
1. Using Radium
->we can make hover, media queries etc

2. CSS Modules
-> we need to enable css module 
$ npm run eject
we will make changes into configuration file , so use eject method. After ejecting u will find new config adnd script directories into your project
->add below changes in webpack.config.dev.js
 


 *Stateful and  Stateless components
 -function based components are stateless, mostly used for writing logic, make use of it often
 - Class based components are stateful  (use as less as possible), Containers(in our example , App.js is an container)
